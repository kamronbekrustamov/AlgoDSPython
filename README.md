# Algorithms and Data Structures in Python

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures in Python, primarily focusing on LeetCode problems.

## Folder Structure

*   `leetcode/`: Contains solutions to LeetCode problems, categorized by difficulty (easy, medium, hard).
    *   `easy/`: Easy-level problems.
    *   `medium/`: Medium-level problems.
    *   `hard/`: Hard-level problems.

## Getting Started

To run the solutions, you'll need Python installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AlgoDSPython.git
    cd AlgoDSPython
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Each problem typically has a `.py` file containing the solution.

To run a specific solution, navigate to the respective folder and execute the Python file.

Example:

```bash
python leetcode/medium/TwoSum.py
```
